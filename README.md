# Download code block

Simplistic JavaScript-only DokuWiki plugin adding download buttons to code
blocks.

## Filename

The text of the element preceding the code block (e.g. a heading) is interpreted
as the file name for the download if it ends with a file extension (dot followed
by letters, numbers or underscores). Full paths (with separators `/` or `\`) are
handled properly.
